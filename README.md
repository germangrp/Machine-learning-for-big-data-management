Machine learning codes for educational purpose; these codes might be helpful for those who are starting in the beautiful field of Data science. 

Big data: Big data refers to data sets so large and complex that traditional data management and analysis tools are not adequate to handle them.\
Big data characteristics (5Vs):\
1-Volume:\
  -Massive amount of generate and storaged data.\
  -Raises technological challenges of storaged, managment, processing and analysis.\
2-Velocity:\
  -Speed at which data is generated, processed and analyzed. Not only matters the amount of data, but also the velocity of which this data are captured and transformed in useful information.\
3-Variety:\
  -Data comes from multiple sources and may be in a variety of formats, posing unique challenges and opportunities for data analysis and integration.\
  +Types:\
  -Structured.\
  -Unstructured.\
  -Semi Structured.\
4-Veracity:\
  -Refers to the quality and reliability of the data.\
5-Value:\
 -Refers to the habilitie of the data to generate tangible and valuable benefits.


Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities.

Machine learning: Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\
1-Regression: Statistical method used in data analysis to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\
+Types:\
-Linear Regression.\
-Polynomial Regression.\
-Ridge and Lasso Regression.\
-Logistic Regression.\
2-Asociation rule learning: Techniques used to discover interesting relationships between variables in large data sets.\
+Comun terms:\
-Item.\
-Transaction.\
-Support.\
-Confidence.\
-Lift.\
3-Clustering: A data analysis technique that groups a set of objects into clusters so that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters.\
+Types:\
-Partitional Clustering.\
-Herarquical Clustering.\
-Density based Clustering.\
4-Classification: A supervised learning technique used to predict the category or class of new observations based on a training data set.\
+Types:\
-Decision trees.\
-Bayes' rule.\
-Support Vector Machine (SVM).\
5-Time series: A time series is a sequence of data collected at specific time intervals and arranged chronologically.\
6-Neural Networks:A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.
